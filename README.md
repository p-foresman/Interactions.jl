Interactions.jl is an evolutionary game theory simulation framework.

– Run scalable simulations for agent-based evolutionary game-theoretic models.
– Built in support for both SQLite and PostgreSQL, enabling reproducible experimentation, checkpointing, and post hoc analysis.
– Supports scalable, parallel execution of independent simulations locally via Distributed.jl.
– User-defined configuration through TOML files for flexible and reproducible simulation builds.
